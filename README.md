What is the convention for naming classes in CSS?
- Some of the most common conventions for naming classes in CSS are 1.Make sure that the name of the class describes easily the targeted element being styled. Make it simple and clear and try not to use more than 2 words to describe an element; 2. Always use class names at the lowest possible level for better code structure and naming conventions like Block Element Modifier (BEM); 3. Avoid using camelCase typing since it makes classes harder to read; 4. Use fully descriptive words for the most part, except for common cases like nav,txt,url, etc. 5. Unsemantic classes should only describe their properties explicitly. 

What is one way to stop a form from submitting with JavaScript?
- One of the ways to stop a form from submitting with JavaScript is by implementing a validation function that returns the value of the function, either true or false, to stop the execution of it and a preventDefault to prevent the default form action of submitting.

When and how should HTML code be validated?
- You shoud validate your HTML code once you have the whole structure of the HTML and are ready to start the debugging and optimization process.This validation will help to be more visible in the search engine, it provides faster and better rendering while preventing problems before they happen. In order to validate you can use an online HTML validator which will automatically tell the user what is not correctly written. The same concept applies to CSS

What is the DOM? Please explain in your own words.
- The DOM is a platform that treats HTML documents as a tree structure, treating each part of the document as a node, which allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the structure, style or content of a document.

Which one is better: CSS Grid, Flexbox or just plain CSS?
- It depends on what you are trying to achieve. Grid is best for arranging elements in multiple rows and columns and gives you more control on each one of the rows and columns, whereas Flexbox is best used for arranging elements in a single row or single column. You can always use plain CSS and achieve the same results but it will take you considerably longer and you will be prone to bugs and functionality issues. At the end of the day Grid and Flexbox are here to help programmers and each of them have their specific uses.
